# Ligma

A lightweight Figma — Rust core compiled to WebAssembly, React chrome, Cloudflare backend.

Like Figma's original architecture, the editor core is not JavaScript: the document
model, tools, camera, hit-testing, undo history, and canvas rendering all live in
`ligma-core` (Rust → WASM). React owns only the chrome — panels, toolbar — and
forwards raw input events to the engine, reading back immutable scene snapshots
keyed by a generation counter.

## Layout

```
crates/ligma-core      Editor engine (Rust → WASM via wasm-bindgen)
apps/worker            Hono on Cloudflare Workers — document API + static assets
apps/web               React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind frontend
```

`/` is the file browser (anonymous create, recent files); the editor lives at
`/d/:id` (TanStack Router). Creating a file mints an 80-bit random id and a D1
row. All content reads/writes route through a **Durable Object per document**
— the single-writer authority that serializes version bumps and hosts the
document's presence room: WebSocket sessions carrying live named cursors and
"new version saved" notifications, so other editors see your cursor and pick
up your saves in real time (local unsaved changes are never clobbered; last
writer wins). Content lives in R2 as versioned, immutable JSON blobs
(`docs/{id}/v{n}.json`); D1 holds metadata and the `current_version` pointer. Locally, wrangler emulates D1/R2/DOs via Miniflare
— no Cloudflare account needed for development. (If `database_id` in
wrangler.toml ever changes, re-run `npm run db:local`: local D1 state is keyed
by that id.)

Documents carry a `version` field; `load_json` migrates older formats forward
(v1 flat `fill` strings → v2 paint lists) so the format can keep evolving.

## Develop

```sh
./scripts/dev.sh   # installs deps, builds WASM if missing, runs worker + vite
```

Or by hand:

```sh
# 1. Build the engine (rerun after changing ligma-core)
cd apps/web && npm run wasm

# 2. Backend worker (port 8787; first time: npm install && npm run db:local)
cd apps/worker && npm run dev

# 3. Frontend (port 5173, proxies /api to the worker)
cd apps/web && npm install && npm run dev
```

Engine smoke tests (headless, no browser): `cd apps/web && node smoke.mjs`
(requires the worker running for the persistence tests).

## Deploy

```sh
wrangler d1 create ligma          # paste database_id into wrangler.toml
wrangler r2 bucket create ligma-docs
cd apps/worker && npm run db:remote && npm run deploy
```

## Editor

| | |
|---|---|
| `V` `F` `R` `O` `T` `H` | Move, Frame, Rectangle, Ellipse, Text, Hand |
| Drag / click | Draw a shape (click places a default size) |
| `Space`-drag | Pan · scroll pans · `⌘`+scroll / pinch zooms |
| `⌘Z` / `⇧⌘Z` | Undo / redo |
| `⌘G` / `⇧⌘G` | Group / ungroup |
| `⌘C` `⌘X` `⌘V` | Copy, cut, paste (engine clipboard; pastes cascade) |
| `⌘]` / `⌘[` | Bring to front / send to back |
| `⌘D`, `⌫`, arrows | Duplicate, delete, nudge (`⇧` = 10px) |
| `⌥`-drag | Drag a copy (original stays put) |
| Right-click | Context menu (clipboard, z-order, group, lock, hide…) |
| Double-click | Edit text in place · rename a frame via its label |
| `⇧1` / `⌘0` / `⌘±` | Zoom to fit / 100% / in & out |
| `C` | Comment mode — click the canvas to pin a comment |
| `⌘S` | Save now (documents also autosave after edits) |

Drawing inside a frame parents the shape to that frame; selecting multiple
shapes (or a group) shows resize handles on the joint bounding box.

## Collaboration

Documents are multiplayer-aware: everyone in a file sees each other's
named cursors live, saves propagate to other editors automatically,
comments pin to canvas positions (press `C`, click, type), and a
floating session chat relays through the same presence room.

## Roadmap (Figma 1.0 scope)

- Frame clipping (children clip to their frame)
- Gradients
- Vector pen tool and boolean operations (flatten, union, subtract, …)
- Rich text: styling spans inside a text node
- Components and instances
- Multiplayer co-editing (per-operation sync; presence/saves already live)
